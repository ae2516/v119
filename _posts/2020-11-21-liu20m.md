abstract: We propose a class of kernel-based two-sample tests, which aim to determine
  whether two sets of samples are drawn from the same distribution. Our tests are
  constructed from kernels parameterized by deep neural nets, trained to maximize
  test power. These tests adapt to variations in distribution smoothness and shape
  over space, and are especially suited to high dimensions and complex data. By contrast,
  the simpler kernels used in prior kernel testing work are spatially homogeneous,
  and adaptive only in lengthscale. We explain how this scheme includes popular classifier-based
  two-sample tests as a special case, but improves on them in general. We provide
  the first proof of consistency for the proposed adaptation method, which applies
  both to kernels on deep features and to simpler radial basis kernels or multiple
  kernel learning. In experiments, we establish the superior performance of our deep
  kernels in hypothesis testing on benchmark and real-world data. The code of our
  deep-kernel-based two-sample tests is available at github.com/fengliu90/DK-for-TST.
