abstract: Existing techniques for certifying the robustness of models for discrete
  data either work only for a small class of models or are general at the expense
  of efficiency or tightness. Moreover, they do not account for sparsity in the input
  which, as our findings show, is often essential for obtaining non-trivial guarantees.
  We propose a model-agnostic certificate based on the randomized smoothing framework
  which subsumes earlier work and is tight, efficient, and sparsity-aware. Its computational
  complexity does not depend on the number of discrete categories or the dimension
  of the input (e.g. the graph size), making it highly scalable. We show the effectiveness
  of our approach on a wide variety of models, datasets, and tasks – specifically
  highlighting its use for Graph Neural Networks. So far, obtaining provable guarantees
  for GNNs has been difficult due to the discrete and non-i.i.d. nature of graph data.
  Our method can certify any GNN and handles perturbations to both the graph structure
  and the node attributes.
