abstract: Polyak momentum (PM), also known as the heavy-ball method, is a widely used
  optimization method that enjoys an asymptotic optimal worst-case complexity on quadratic
  objectives. However, its remarkable empirical success is not fully explained by
  this optimality, as the worst-case analysis –contrary to the average-case– is not
  representative of the expected complexity of an algorithm. In this work we establish
  a novel link between PM and the average-case analysis. Our main contribution is
  to prove that any optimal average-case method converges in the number of iterations
  to PM, under mild assumptions. This brings a new perspective on this classical method,
  showing that PM is asymptotically both worst-case and average-case optimal.
